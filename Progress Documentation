Current Progress — Milestone 1
Set up development environment with:

C++20 (MSVC toolchain)
CMake build system
vcpkg package manager
Dependencies: GLFW (window/input) + GLAD (OpenGL loader)
Configured working “Hello Window” OpenGL context

Result:
Successfully opened a resizable OpenGL window with a dark background.
This confirms graphics pipeline + build system are working.
Paves the way for physics and rendering code in later milestones.
